# Listric_fault_data
Observed gravity anomaly data for real listric fault structure.
The observed gravity anomaly data for real listric fault structure is digitized from the paper [Chakravarthi, V., Kumar, M. P., Ramamma, B., \& Sastry, S. R. (2017), Gravity anomaly interpretation of 2D fault morphologies by means of nonplanar fault planes and exponential density contrast model: a space domain technique. Arabian Journal of Geosciences, 10(3), 64] from figure 3a.
the first column of the table represents the observation points in km and the second column represents the observed gravity anomalies in mGal.
